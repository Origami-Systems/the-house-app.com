## Cheering

**Cheering** is a way for users to show support for their house games. When *10* users press the **Cheer** button during a game, everyone viewing the game will see confetti for that house.

This feature encourages participation and lets houses see which of their members are actively supporting them during a game.

### How It Works
- Each user can cheer multiple times, but there is a **2-minute cooldown** between cheers.
- Confetti appears automatically when the 10 cheer threshold is reached.
- Cheering does not affect scores or outcomes—it is purely visual and for fun.
- Once the game is over, **Admins** can view the archives page to see how many times each house was cheered.
