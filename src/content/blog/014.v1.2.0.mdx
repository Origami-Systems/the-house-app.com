This update introduces a stronger account security with support for an Authenticator App.

## Authenticator App
There is now support for using an authenticator app for two-factor authentication. You can set this up in the [Account Security](https://app.the-house-app.com/?redirect=/account/security) page in your account.

## Security Page Improvements
The Account Security page has been redesigned to provide a better user experience. It now includes a new section for managing your Authenticator App and Passkeys.

## Calendar Swiping
On mobile, you can now swipe left and right on the calendar to navigate between months.

## Bug Fixes

- When the website is reloaded auto login will now work as expected.
- The cheer button now stays disabled until the timeout is complete.

# Bugs and Feedback
As always, if you notice any bugs or have feedback, please share it on the [Account Page](https://app.the-house-app.com/?redirect=/account/security).
