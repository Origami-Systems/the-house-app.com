This update introduces a new game type, Bracket, and the ability to view archived users and houses.

## Bracket Game Type
If your organization has an *even* number of houses, you can now select the Bracket game type when starting a game. This creates a tournament-style game where houses compete in a bracket format. Matches are automatically generated, and winners advance until a champion is determined.

## Admin Archive Page
Instead of deleting users and houses, they must now be archived instead deleted. This allows admins to view past users and houses in the admin page. You can also restore archived users and houses if needed. A new Games Archive page also lets you view past games and their details.

## Bug Fixes

- Sidebar now automatically closes when navigating to a different page.

# Bugs and Feedback
As always, if you notice any bugs or have feedback, please share it on the account page.
