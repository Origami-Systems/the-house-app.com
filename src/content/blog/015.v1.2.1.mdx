This update brings bug fixes and UI fixes and improvements to the edit pages.

## Edit Page Improvements
The edit pages have been improved to provide a better user experience. The layout has been redesigned to make it easier to edit the information you need. There is also one save button that will save all changes, instead of having a save button for each item.

## Bug Fixes

- Point Presets sometimes not displaying
- Text and UI elements are now properly selectable where appropriate
